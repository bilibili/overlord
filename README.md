# Overlord [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixhao/overlord.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixhao/overlord) [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/felixhao/overlord/proxy?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/felixhao/overlord/proxy)


Overlord is a proxy based high performance Memcached and Redis solution written in Go.  
It is fast and lightweight and used primarily to horizontally scale your distributed caching architecture.  
It is inspired by Twemproxy,Codis.  

## Quick Start

#### Download

```go
go get github.com/felixhao/overlord
```

#### Build

```shell
cd $GOPATH/github.com/felixhao/overlord/cmd/proxy
go build
```

#### Run

```shell
./proxy -cluster=proxy-cluster-example.toml
```
###### Please first run a memcache server, which bind 11211 port.

#### Test

```shell
echo -e "set a_11 0 0 5\r\nhello\r" | nc 127.0.0.1 21211
# STORED
echo -e "get a_11\r" | nc 127.0.0.1 21211
# VALUE a_11 0 5
# hello
# END
```

Congratulations! You've just run the overlord proxy.
